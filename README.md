# WCC

A PHP Web client library with built-in caching.

## Supported Response Formats

The WCC library currently contains classes for parsing response data from:

- dbpedia.org SPARQL queries
- RSS feeds
- YouTube video API response feeds

## TODOs

- Use common naming scheme derived from RSS for getParsedResponse data arrays to facilitate combination of results to RSS feeds
